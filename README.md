# Telling Stories with Data- Shishank Profile

Welcome to my Telling Stories with Data portfolio, a space where I combine analytical thinking and storytelling to transform complex datasets into clear, compelling narratives. Every dataset tells a story and my goal is to uncover it. This portfolio showcases how I turn raw numbers into meaningful insights through data visualization and design.

# About me
Hi! I’m **Shishank Sharma** (he/him), a graduate student in the **Master of Science in Public Policy and Management (MSPPM)** program at **Carnegie Mellon University**. With a background in data analytics, strategic communication, and leadership, I’m passionate about leveraging data storytelling to solve complex global challenges.

# What I hope to learn
Build advanced skills in _data storytelling and visualization_ to make complex ideas simple and engaging.

Explore _creative tools and platforms_ (like Tableau, GitHub, and interactive dashboards) to share insights effectively.
