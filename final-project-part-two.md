# Wireframes / storyboards

Using last week’s sketches as the foundation, I developed the story outline into more structured wireframes:

**Intro**  Headline: “Financing Peace: Trends in UN Peacekeeping Budgets”.

![image1170x530cropped (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30e525a2-9b2c-4f9a-88fa-0c948f2a79e2)


Subtext: Explains why budgets matter for global conflict management.

**Section 1 –  Visualization: Line chart (2010–2024) of annual UN peacekeeping budgets.**

Visual: Static Line chart breaking down a peacekeeping budget by category (military, police, civilian, operational).

Narrative: Introduces readers to the scale of peacekeeping costs.

**Section 2 – Fluctuations and Trends**



Narrative: Connects budget spikes/dips to geopolitical events.

**Section 3 – Mission Comparisons**

Draft Visualization: Bar chart of the top 5 most expensive missions by annual budget (e.g., DRC, Mali, Darfur, South Sudan, Lebanon).

Narrative: Highlights which missions consistently consume the most resources and why.

**Section 4 – Implications**

Visual: Flow diagram showing link between Budgets → Operations → Outcomes → Policy Lessons.

Narrative: Discusses how financial choices reflect political priorities and operational challenges.

# User research 

## Target audience

This project aims to reach:

**Policy students** – to give them insight into global security priorities and financing trends.

**Researchers on UN Missions** – to provide data stories and trends over the years of various UN missions and spendings categories

**UN Staff** - to compare financial commitments with rhetoric and policy goals.

Approach: I interviewed one UN employee (practitioner) and two policy students at Carnegie Mellon University. This ensured perspectives from both professional and academic audiences.


## Interview script

**Research Goals**

Understand baseline knowledge of peacekeeping budgets.

Identify which visualization formats are most intuitive.

Determine whether the narrative arc improves comprehension.

Collect suggestions to improve clarity and engagement.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Assess baseline knowledge|   How familiar are you with UN peacekeeping budgets or financing processes?               |
|   Evaluate visualization preferences   |            Which visualization (line chart, bar chart, map) do you find most useful? Why?      |
| Measure relevance      |   Would this story/data be useful for your studies or work?            |
  Test narrative flow    |           Did the flow (context → trends → insights) make sense?    |
  Gather improvements    |What would make this story more engaging or clearer for you?|
