# Wireframes / storyboards

Using last week’s sketches as the foundation, I developed the story outline into more structured wireframes:

Landing / Intro

Hero Image: UN peacekeepers on deployment (field photo).

Headline: “Financing Peace: Trends in UN Peacekeeping Budgets”.

Subtext: Explains why budgets matter for global conflict management.

Section 1 – Context

Visual: Static infographic breaking down a peacekeeping budget by category (military, police, civilian, operational).

Narrative: Introduces readers to the scale of peacekeeping costs.

Section 2 – Fluctuations and Trends

Draft Visualization: Line chart (2000–2024) of annual UN peacekeeping budgets, annotated with major events (Darfur 2007 surge, Mali 2013 start, Haiti/Liberia drawdowns).

Narrative: Connects budget spikes/dips to geopolitical events.

Section 3 – Mission Comparisons

Draft Visualization: Bar chart of the top 5 most expensive missions by annual budget (e.g., DRC, Mali, Darfur, South Sudan, Lebanon).

Narrative: Highlights which missions consistently consume the most resources and why.

Section 4 – Implications

Visual: Flow diagram showing link between Budgets → Operations → Outcomes → Policy Lessons.

Narrative: Discusses how financial choices reflect political priorities and operational challenges.

# User research 

## Target audience
This project aims to reach:

**Policy students** – to understand global security priorities and financing trends.

**Researchers** – to evaluate resource allocation and mission efficiency.

**Policy practitioners**/ **UN Staff** - to compare financial commitments with rhetoric and policy goals.

Approach: I interviewed one UN employee (practitioner) and two policy students at Carnegie Mellon. This ensured perspectives from both professional and academic audiences.


## Interview script

**Research Goals**

Understand baseline knowledge of peacekeeping budgets.

Identify which visualization formats are most intuitive.

Determine whether the narrative arc improves comprehension.

Collect suggestions to improve clarity and engagement.
