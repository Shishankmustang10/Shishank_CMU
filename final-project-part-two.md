# Wireframes / storyboards

Using last week’s sketches as the foundation, I developed the story outline into more structured wireframes:

**Intro**  Headline: “Financing Peace: Trends in UN Peacekeeping Budgets”.

![image1170x530cropped (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30e525a2-9b2c-4f9a-88fa-0c948f2a79e2)


Subtext: Explains why budgets matter for global conflict management.

**Section 1 –  Visualization: Line chart (2010–2024) of annual UN peacekeeping budgets.**

Visual: Static Line chart breaking down a peacekeeping budget by category (military, police, civilian, operational).

Narrative: Introduces readers to the scale of peacekeeping costs.

**Section 2 – Fluctuations and Trends**



Narrative: Connects budget spikes/dips to geopolitical events.

**Section 3 – Mission Comparisons**

Draft Visualization: Bar chart of the top 5 most expensive missions by annual budget (e.g., DRC, Mali, Darfur, South Sudan, Lebanon).

Narrative: Highlights which missions consistently consume the most resources and why.

**Section 4 – Implications**

Visual: Flow diagram showing link between Budgets → Operations → Outcomes → Policy Lessons.

Narrative: Discusses how financial choices reflect political priorities and operational challenges.

# User research 

## Target audience

This project aims to reach:

**Policy students** – to give them insight into global security priorities and financing trends.

**Researchers on UN Missions** – to provide data stories and trends over the years of various UN missions and spendings categories

**UN Staff** - to compare financial commitments with rhetoric and policy goals.

Approach: I interviewed one UN employee (practitioner) and two policy students at Carnegie Mellon University. This ensured perspectives from both professional and academic audiences.


## Interview script

**Research Goals**

Understand baseline knowledge of peacekeeping budgets.

Identify which visualization formats are most intuitive.

Determine whether the narrative arc improves comprehension.

Collect suggestions to improve clarity and engagement.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Assess baseline knowledge|   How familiar are you with UN peacekeeping budgets or financing processes?               |
|   Evaluate visualization preferences   |            Which visualization (line chart, bar chart, map) do you find most useful? Why?      |
| Measure relevance      |   Would this story/data be useful for your studies or work?            |
  Test narrative flow    |           Did the flow (context → trends → insights) make sense?    |
  Gather improvements    |What would make this story more engaging or clearer for you?|



## Interview findings


| Questions               | Interview 1 (UN Employee) | Interview 2 (Policy Student)| Interview 3 (Policy Student)|
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Familiarity |	Very familiar with UN processes, but surprised at visual clarity of budget shifts.|	Knew peacekeeping existed, but unaware of cost scale.	|Only surface-level knowledge of UN budgets.|
Visualization preference|	Map and stacked bar (operational vs. personnel costs).|	Line chart over time was easiest to follow.|	Liked comparative bar chart of missions. |
Usefulness |	Helpful for policy debates on financing vs. rhetoric. |	Useful for coursework in global security. |	Helped contextualize priorities over time. |
Narrative flow	| Clear, but suggested adding short case anecdotes.	| Easy to follow, wanted more annotations on spikes. |	Logical, but recommended more visual storytelling. |
Suggestions	| Glossary for acronyms, budget category breakdown. |	Callouts for spikes in timeline. |	Case studies and mission images to engage audience. |
|                         |                                |             |             |
|                         |                                |             |             |

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UN staff wanted breakdown by category	|Add stacked bar chart: personnel vs. operational costs. |
Students needed clearer context for spikes	| Annotate line chart with mission events. |
Audience requested case anecdotes |	Add callout boxes on Darfur and Mali missions. |
Acronyms could confuse readers |	Add glossary/tooltip feature for acronyms like DPO, MONUSCO.|
Maps were impactful for practitioners |	Create interactive map with budgets by mission region.|                                                                             |

**Final Thoughts**  The research confirmed the value of combining multiple visualization styles: line chart for trends, bar chart for comparisons, map for geography. I’ll refine the story with case anecdotes, glossary features, and stronger visual storytelling to balance technical accuracy.

I used ChatGPT, Perplexity and Google gemini to help structure my project proposal and refine the story arc for clarity. Specifically, AI assistance was used to: To generate ideas. Refine and structure my story arc and wireframes, synthesize interview insights, Polish the language for academic and professional tone, Formatting of references to frame the dataset in context. All final ideas, interpretations, and project directions remain my own, and I will further adapt them based on my research and Part II assesment feedback.
