# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II

I expanded the initial sketches and text drafts into full wireframes and visual story sections. The key changes includes following:

**Heading Refinement:**
The earlier heading "**Annual Un Peacekeeping Budgets**" version provided a descriptive overview of UN peacekeeping budgets, but was not engaging. The updated heading is "**Financing Peace: Trends in UN Peacekeeping Budgets**" builds a stronger story arc, directly focusing on why UN budgets matters.

**Trends and fluctuations**: Based on student interview ffedback, annotated line chart with various global and UN mission events which had an impact on UN budget(Covid etc)

**Comparisons UN Missions**: Through stacked Bar chart highlighted three UN missions having the buggest budgets.

**From Budgets to Policy Lessons**: Based on Prof Goranson feedback, focused on devloping a story through **policy lessons** apart from viz.

**Visual Expansion:**

1. Added a stacked line chart (2010–2024) showing annual peacekeeping budgets categorized by personnel (military, police, civilian) and operational costs.
2. Introduced a bar chart highlighting three most expensive UN missions (MONUSCO, MINUSMA, UNMISS).
3. Ehanced graphs through labeling based on one of the student feedback, also correlated its impact through color coding of text below (e.g., MONUSCO, MINUSMA, UNMISS)


## The audience

The audience for this data story includes **UN member states, policymakers, think tank organizations, researchers, and policy students** who seek to understand how peacekeeping finances reflect global security priorities. 

To ensure the story resonates across these groups, I conducted interviews with one UN practitioner and two policy students, capturing both professional and academic perspectives. Their feedback emphasized the need for clarity, contextual storytelling, and visual simplicity. As a result, the final story was designed with tailored adjustments: for policy students (ages 22–25), I simplified the language, refined the narrative flow, and used intuitive graphs with clear legends and for policy practitioners and UN staff (ages 40+), I expanded the final section to connect budgets with strategic implications. 

**Call to Action**: As peacekeeping continues to evolve amid shifting conflicts and fiscal pressures, understanding these budgets is the first step toward holding the UN and its member states accountable for their commitments.

## Final design decisions

Based on Prof Goranson’s feedback and the interview results, I focused on strengthening the narrative and linking data to policy insights rather than just visualizing trends. While I couldn’t implement all interview recommendations due to time and effort constraints following an **impact-effort assessment**. I prioritized the changes that added the most value, such as annotated charts, simplified visuals, and clearer storytelling. 

Although some interactive features and maps remain pending, I’m satisfied that the final story feels cohesive and balanced. It effectively integrates data, visuals, and narrative flow, creating a homogeneous and meaningful account of how UN peacekeeping budgets reflect global priorities.

## AI acknowledgements

I used ChatGPT, Perplexity and Google gemini to help structure my project proposal and refine the story arc for clarity. Specifically, AI assistance was used to refine and structure my story arc and wireframes, synthesize interview insights, Polish the language. All final ideas, interpretations, and project directions remain my own.

# Final thoughts

Working on  Shorthand, tableau and GitHub was both challenging and rewarding. Getting used to the platforms and its interactive tools took a bit of time, but it turned out to be a great learning experience in how to tell stories with data. Choosing the right visuals and finding the right balance between clarity and design was probably what took me the longest. I had to think carefully about how to present UN budget trends in a way that made sense without overloading the reader.

This project meant a lot to me because I had previously interned with the UN’s Information Management Unit, where I worked on data visualization for peacekeeping. Bringing that experience into this project really helped me see how data, storytelling, and impact come together. Even though I couldn’t add all the interactive elements I wanted, I’m happy with how cohesive and meaningful the final story feels.
