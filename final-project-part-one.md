# Outline: This dataset presents annual budgetary appropriations extracted from the performance reports of the Secretary-General. It comprises approved budget data for peacekeeping operations during each financial period.

The dataset reflects gross requirements, defined as the total of all categories and subcategories of appropriations and expenditures (military and police personnel, civilian personnel, and operational costs). This corresponds to the “Gross requirements” line as presented in the official budget performance tables. It should be noted that staff assessment income and voluntary contributions in kind (budgeted) are excluded from this dataset.


# Story Structure 

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Text here...

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

# Method and medium
The story will trace the financial scale and evolution of UN peacekeeping missions, highlighting how resources are allocated, and what this reveals about international priorities over time.

Beginning (Context / Setup): Introduce the UN peacekeeping system and its role in global security. Provide background on how peacekeeping is funded and why budgets matter (they reflect political will and international consensus). The one-sentence summary: "UN peacekeeping budgets reveal the shifting priorities and challenges of global conflict management."

Middle (Conflict / Rising Tension): Explore trends and changes in the budget across different years and missions. Highlight spikes or declines that correspond to key geopolitical events (e.g., major missions in Africa, drawdowns in the Balkans, or post–Cold War surge). Compare costs across categories—military, police, civilian, and operational—to show how priorities shift within the missions themselves.

End (Resolution / Takeaway): Conclude with insights into what the budgetary patterns mean for the future of peacekeeping. For example: the financial burden vs. global demand, sustainability of missions, or the tension between member states’ willingness to fund peacekeeping and the UN’s mandate to maintain peace and security. Leave the audience with the thought: Peacekeeping budgets are more than numbers—they are indicators of how the world chooses to invest in peace.

The story arc follows:

Exposition: What UN peacekeeping is, why the budgets matter.

Rising Action: Trends, spikes, and dips over time.

Climax: A specific moment where peacekeeping budgets reached a critical point (e.g., post-2010 peak).

Falling Action: How the UN and member states responded.

Resolution: Lessons for the future of global governance and peace operations.

User Stories:

As a student of international policy, I want to see how funding changes over time so I can understand global conflict management priorities.

As a researcher, I want to analyze which missions consumed the most resources to evaluate efficiency and effectiveness.

As a policymaker, I want to know how financial commitments align with political rhetoric on peacekeeping.

I used ChatGPT, Perplexity and Google gemini to help structure my project proposal and refine the story arc for clarity. Specifically, AI assistance was used to:

Draft the Story Structure section (arc, user stories, and one-sentence summary).
