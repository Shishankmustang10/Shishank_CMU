In my final redesign, I only focused on Australia, US, Canada and Japan, not the whole OECD data. I picked these countries because of the size of their  economies and their debt-to-GDP ratio is impacting the whole world. If I show too many countries, the chart looks messy, so I just keep four  lines. This makes it easy to compare. 

Heading chosen is QUAD of Aus-US- Canada- Japan : Debt to GDP Ratio

Color Codes: All four countries are represented by different color
